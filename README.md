# Chaskey
Verilog implementation of the Chaskey lightweight message authentication code (MAC) function.


## Status
Implementation just started. Not completed. Does not work.
**Do. Not. Use**


## Introduction
[Chaskey(pdf)](https://eprint.iacr.org/2014/386.pdf) is a lightweight
message authentication code (MAC) function designed to be efficient on
32-bit processors. A version of the function, Chaskey-12 has been
standardized by ISO/IEC.

This core is a hardware implementation of the function written in
Verilog. The core sports a top level wrapper with a 32-bit interface.

This repository contains a reference model (in src/model) by the Chaskey
author [NickyMouha](https://mouha.be/) on his [Chaskey
page](https://mouha.be/chaskey/). The code is used here to generate test
vectors and intermediate values.


## Implementation
TBW.
